# Food Recommendation System using KBS and ML

The User Diet Analysis Application is an intelligent system designed to assist users in achieving their dietary goals through personalized meal recommendations. By leveraging Knowledge-Based Systems (KBS) and Machine Learning (ML), the system tailors dietary plans based on user inputs such as age, weight, height, medical conditions, and fitness objectives.

The system ensures that recommendations align with recognized medical standards, making it suitable for users with specific dietary needs, including allergies, pre-existing health conditions, and personal dietary preferences (vegetarian/non-vegetarian).

## Features


Health Questionnaire: Users complete a form to provide essential personal details, including:

Age, gender, height, weight
Allergies and health conditions
Activity level (athletic or sedentary)
Dietary goal (weight gain, weight loss, maintenance, muscle building)
Diet preference (vegetarian or non-vegetarian)


Nutritional Analysis: Generates a daily summary of essential nutrients such as:

Calories, protein, carbohydrates, fiber, sugar
Fats (total, saturated), sodium, cholesterol
Personalized Meal Recommendations:

Suggests suitable foods based on targeted nutritional values.
Provides meal suggestions for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
Ensures meals align with user-specific dietary needs.

## Technology

Knowledge-Based System (KBS) Role :


BMI & Nutritional Calculation: The system calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) and daily nutritional needs based on user inputs.
Rule-Based Decision Making: Applies predefined medical and dietary rules to determine appropriate nutritional intake and meal recommendations.


Machine Learning (ML) Role :

Food Recommendation with Nearest Neighbors Algorithm:
Uses KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) to find foods from the dataset that closely match the user's required nutritional values.
Suggests meals based on similarity to the userâ€™s dietary profile, ensuring balanced and personalized food choices.


## Dataset

The project utilizes the Food.com Recipes and Reviews dataset from Kaggle, which includes a variety of food recipes and user reviews.
